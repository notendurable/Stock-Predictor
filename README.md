# Stock Price Prediction Using Different Regression Models


  ## Dataset
  [World Stock Prices Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nelgiriyewithana/world-stock-prices-daily-updating)

  The dataset used for this project includes:
- Date: The date of the stock price data.
- Open: The opening price of the stock on that date.
- High: The highest price the stock reached during the trading day.
- Low: The lowest price the stock reached during the trading day.
- Close: The closing price of the stock on that date.
- Volume: The trading volume, i.e., the number of shares traded on that date.

# Regression Models Explored

The project explores the following regression models:

## 1. **Linear Regression**
   - A basic linear approach to modeling the relationship between the dependent variable (stock price) and one or more independent variables.

## 2. **Logistic Regression**
   - Despite its name, logistic regression is commonly used for binary classification. In this context, it may be applied for certain stock price prediction scenarios.

## 3. **Decision Tree Regression**
   - A tree-like model of decisions that can be useful for capturing complex relationships in the data.

## 4. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Regression**
   - A non-parametric method that makes predictions based on the average of the 'k' nearest neighbors.

## 5. **Ridge Regression**
   - A regularization technique that aims to prevent multicollinearity in multiple regression data.

## 6. **Lasso Regression**
   - Similar to Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression also involves regularization, but it tends to produce sparse coefficient estimates, effectively performing feature selection.

## 7. **Bayesian Ridge Regression**
   - A Bayesian approach to linear regression, incorporating regularization to stabilize the model.

## 8. **Polynomial Regression**
   - An extension of linear regression, where polynomial features are included to capture more complex relationships in the data.
